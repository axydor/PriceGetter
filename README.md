# What is this?
This is my simple and humble hobby project. 
This repository holds the scripts that are used of keeping track of the items 
from various Turkish e-commerce websites via telegram bot or command line tool. 

Fetching whole website is also possible.

List of available websites can be found by asking /support to the telegram bot or
search NAME_TAGS in this repository

# How did it start?
I wanted to build a PC with my friend, for that purpose we prepared a list of items, 
but the problem was we did not have enough time to monitor prices of the each item, 
Since there were too many different sites we did not want to download and register 
to each site's app, so we wanted a single application to track all these items from 
different websites. 

TLDR: This project was born because of mine laziness.

# What do not this provide?

This project is not aimed to search and find the cheapest product from websites, instead you provide the urls of those items/products and it notifies you when there is a price change

# price_getter.py
This is a generic script to scrape price information from websites.

It requires a single url or a file that contains bunch of urls as an input.
The result with item prices is saved in a file

# site_getter.py
This module fetches the site as whole along with categories inside

# utils/item_db.py
This module uses peewee ORM to save fetched products in sqlite database

# utils/proxy.py
This scipt fetches available proxies to be later used with requests.get()
Because some sites ban abusive scraping methods that we are using with multiple threads

# utils/mail.py
This module is used for sending the prices of the items which are
fetched by the price_getter module.

# utils/list_prices
This module provides beautiful way to represent fetched results of the items
It takes bunch of text files that are generated by the price_getter module
Since price_getter now sends e-mails it is not being used and maintened any more

# price_bot
This is telegram bot, that is capable of keeping track of the items that
are provided by the user through telegram client. It notifies the user if
price of any item changes.

# Requirements
    pip3 install beautifulsoup4

    pip3 install validators
    pip3 install python-telegram-bot==12.0.0b1 --upgrade
